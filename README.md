# Pytshot
Simple GUI for screenshot terminal commands based on the TkInter module in Python.

Currently, only `scrot` is implemented, but this is easily changed by editing the Python script.

## bash command
The bash command can be installed by

```
git clone https://github.com/tjemsland/pyshot.git
cd pyshot
sudo make install
```

The program is now started by typing `pyshot` in the terminal.

## Python script
Alternatively, the program can be used as a python script by simply typing `python3 pyshot.py`.

## Todo

- The program was made for personal use an evening. As a consequence, the code is very untidy and a cleanup should be done.
- Add a config file to make the program more configurable.
